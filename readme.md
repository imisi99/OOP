# OOP
This is a game created with the concepts of the four pillars of OOP(Object-Oriented-Programming)
It is a simple but interesting game as it requires luck 
What the game is about?:
- A hero which is the player has been created with two enemies alongside the hero
- The hero has a special ability which is being able to equip a weapon in his arsenal(currently sword only), the equipping of the sword is automatic as it activates once the hero HP is low
- The enemies also have a special ability each:
    - Zombie: This is an enemy that has the ability to regenerate HP at random points during battle
    - Ogre: This is an enemy that has the ability to increase his attack damage at a random point during battle 
- The enemies special ability occur at random points as they use the random function but at different percent
- The game uses the sleep function to slow down the game process so to make it run at a nice pace in the terminal to understand what is happening during battle
- The game has two rounds as the hero fights the zombie first and then proceed to fight the Ogre if it wins against the zombie
To run the game you need to have python installed on your Laptop
